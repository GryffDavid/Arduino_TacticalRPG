# Arduino_TacticalRPG
A tactical RPG running on an Arduino microcontroller with a TFT touch screen shield. Uses a custom PCB with physical buttons on for controls.

This project started after someone on a forum somewhere said something along the lines of "You can't make a game with an Arduino because the refresh rate on the screens is too low" which I think I kinda saw as a challenge because I felt like I could make a cool game regardless of that limitation. So the first test was just to see if I could get some simple graphics drawn to the screen with the intention being to check if I could move a character around the screen.

The code makes huge jumps between commits because I wasn't using VCS at the time that I wrote the code so when I got to a point I was happy with and I didn't want to potentially break it, I would just copy-paste the Game or Library folder and increment the number on the end.
